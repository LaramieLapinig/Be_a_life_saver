    <img src="cap.jpg" alt="Lara's photo" class="profile-photo">
    <h2>Hi, I'm Lara!</h2>
    <h3> A proud senior student responder and a passionate advocate for life-saving education. My personal journey began when I joined the Campus Disaster Risk Reduction Management System Unit (CDRRMSU). At first, I was simply curious but as I trained, participated in real-life emergency simulations, and competed in the Rescue Olympics, something within me changed. I found my purpose. Through these experiences, I learned not only how to save lives, but also how to lead under pressure, work as a team, and stay calm during chaos. CDRRMSU didn’t just teach me skills it shaped my mindset, built my confidence, and awakened a deep desire to serve.</h3>
    <h3>My mission is clear. "To empower every individual no matter their background  with the knowledge, courage, and practical tools to take action during emergencies. I believe in:✔️ Preparedness over panic ✔️ Compassion with action ✔️ Learning that saves lives</h3>
    <h3>This website “Be a Lifesaver”is my way of giving back. It’s a platform built from purpose and driven by heart. Whether through education, tech solutions, or community outreach, I aim to make lifesaving skills accessible and inspiring. You don’t need to be a superhero to save a life, just someone who cares enough to learn. Every student, every friend, every bystander we all have the potential to make a difference. Let this space be your starting point. Learn. Be inspired. Take action. One day, you might be the reason someone survives.</h3>
